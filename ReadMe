The program work as asked in the assignment.
Here are certain things i did on my own.
1. if any client download a file the name of the is orginal_file_name_clientid.extention
 or orginal_file_name_clientid(for files without extension). this is done to distingues files between clients.
2. server create a file called server_records.json and maintain the file info in it as well as maintains an internal data structure. 
3. Two client cannot upload files with same name 
4. if some error occurs while operation, a message stating Fail....(reason) is displayed.
5. if a client Exits then all its records including files is deleted from server side.
6. Port no is 5000 and ip address is home ip address(127.0.0.1) by default so no need of providing as argument 
7. filename can be alphanumeric special charaters (except.-_) like @$ are not allowed.
8. in the /insert command to insert a new line or tab user must add \n or \t inside the inverted comma 
for example /invite abcd "this is first line\nthis is second line"
this will append two lines in the file.
as
this is first line
this is second line
9. Server.cpp is kept inside a different folder to differentiate between Server files and client files


Compile using
g++ server.cpp -o server
g++ client.cpp -o client

Run the program as 
./server
./client
